## React Assignment

1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
Ans- Generally we use context API to share the data and functionality across the entire component. It saves us from passing the props manually at every level.  


2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
Ans- because It provides a simple and readable way to manage multiple pieces of local state independently. It allowscontrol over state updates and integrates well with other hooks, making it easier to manage and optimize complex state logic within a component.

3. Design a user interface resembling the provided page. Fetch the data from the server and dynamically map the information cards to the fetched data. Ensure that the search functionality is also implemented.
